# multitouchview

By [David Petrie](http://www.davidpetrie.com)

Multitouchview is an Objective-C++ extension to the GLKView, and is a wrapper around the multitouch functionality of the iPhone and iPod Touch.  This is a fork of the earlier [MultiTouchScreen Project](https://github.com/cdave1/multitouchscreen), which was adapted from the "TouchScreen" class in the [Oolong Engine](http://www.oolongengine.com).

This class is intended to be used in apps that need to synchronize user input and rendering.  It is also useful if you want to convert multitouch input into another form of input, such as mouse or trackball input.

The library is currently used in a game on the iTunes App Store called [Smashed](http://smashed.hackdirt.com).


## Note on the Demo Project

The demo project demonstrates the multitouch screen in an iOS app.  When you initially run the demo, it will show a black screen.  You must touch the screen to see the pretty colours (try with more than one finger).
